            The team also started working on the diagrams for the project, and the individual members
            started working on their own parts of the project. The website was also updated with the
            latest literature reviews.

            Regular Team Meeting - Had a session with the TA, discussing about the progress
            of the project. Moving on to the next phase, we decided to discuss the different
            workloads of each team member and how we should split the work. We also discussed
            about the different technologies we should use for the project. We also discussed
            the design and the functional aspects of the functional prototype.

            The team decided on a topic to work on - Environmental Monitoring:
            Displays environmental sensor data on a map, providing information
            on air pollution, noise levels and more. Users can check current
            environmental conditions on the map, avoid highly polluted areas,
            and choose healthier environments.

            Topics brainstorming - The team met for the first time and decided
            on a topic to work on. Initially, we landed on two ideas. First was
            a hospital oriented application, and the other was an environment
            focused application. After discussions and a general vote by the
            class, we decided to work on the environment application.
