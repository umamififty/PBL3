          <h4>Ruolin - Places of bad environment and data</h4>
          <p>
            This literature review provides an overview of studies and research
            conducted on places with poor environmental conditions. It explores
            various aspects related to the adverse environmental conditions in
            different locations, including industrial zones, and regions
            affected by natural disasters. Taking examine sulfur dioxide (SO2)
            and methane pollution as examples. China has cheap labor, which
            makes many countries invest in China. While the economy has been
            developed, the environment has been polluted. In the past 25 years,
            China has been accompanied by obvious environmental problems. For
            every 1% increase in FDI, the emission of SO2 increases by 0.98%,
            which shows that the emission of SO2 in industrial zones is much
            higher than that in townships [1] . In Portugal, Oporto-MA is the
            region with the highest industrial consumption of electricity,
            Portugal has observed an industrial area (Custoias), two cities
            (Paranhos and Boavista), and a rural area (Vila Nova da Telha) [2].
            The two urban monitoring sites are close to the entrance of the
            highway, where the source of SO2 is traffic emissions, and the
            industrial monitoring site detected twice as much SO2 emissions as
            the rural monitoring site. Therefore, industry and transportation
            are the main sources of SO2. The significant methane emissions from
            cows make cattle farms a substantial source of air pollution.
            Methane, as a potent greenhouse gas, has a much higher warming
            potential compared to carbon dioxide. Its release into the
            atmosphere contributes to the intensification of global warming and
            climate change. About 14% of the world's greenhouse gases come from
            agriculture, with the largest amount being methane. About two-thirds
            of all methane emissions come from cows, which emit about 132
            gallons of methane per day, equivalent to the amount emitted by a
            car in a day[3]. This comes from the fact that cows have four
            stomachs, which are filled with bacteria that aid digestion and
            produce methane during rumination. So cattle farms are also a major
            source of air pollution. Addressing methane emissions from cattle
            farms is crucial for mitigating environmental impacts. Various
            strategies have been proposed to reduce these emissions, including
            dietary modifications, such as incorporating feed additives or
            adjusting feed composition, to minimize methane production in the
            digestive process. Additionally, improvements in manure management
            and the adoption of anaerobic digestion systems can help capture and
            utilize methane as a renewable energy source, thereby reducing
            emissions and promoting sustainability in the agricultural sector.
            In conclusion, when making environmental monitoring software, the
            scope of environmental pollution monitoring can be gradually
            expanded with the factory area, the transportation hub near the
            school and the ruminant farm as the center. Reference [1] He, J.

          <h4>Noise Pollution - Daiki</h4>
          <p>
            Noise pollution Nowadays noise pollution has become a quite familiar
            word that everybody knows in the past 10 years. The word noise is
            from the Latin word “nau-sea” which means sound that is loud and
            unexpected. Since because of rapid urbanization and the changes of
            the lifestyle both indoor and outdoor environment noise pollution
            have become a serious health hazard with increasing adverse effects
            on all ages to fetus to adults and noise induced hearing loss and
            non-auditory adverse effects due to noise pollution are being
            increasingly diagnosed in all age groups. The cause of noise
            pollution in human life can come from many aspects especially
            natural and human made cause. In natural case earthquakes and
            volcanic activity are mainly the two big aspects. It does not happen
            regularly and continuously but once it happens it makes a large
            impact of noise. In human made cause there are many aspects with
            regularly and continuously like for example the vehicles such as
            motorbike, trains, cars, planes. It causes noise pollution due to
            the engine noise and especially if the roads are bad and the
            vehicles uses a poor engine it creates more noise like in the
            developing country. Murli and Murthy (1983) also found that traffic
            noise in Vishakhapatnam exceeds 90dB even in morning hours. The
            second reason of human made cause is the noises generated from the
            industrial buildings. Active industrial buildings produce extremely
            loud noises that annoy the neighborhoods living nearby. Therefore,
            those are the main noise pollution causes. In the report of Narendra
            Singh there is no doubt that the noise affects human health. The
            noise may affect much health for example loss of hearing, high-blood
            pressure, stress, loss of sleep, distraction affecting productivity
            and general reduction in the quality of life and 75 decibels for
            more than eight hours daily for a long period of time can cause loss
            of hearing. The sound produced by a bursting cracker, exceeding
            150dB, can cause a ringing sensation called ʻtinnitus’ and can
            impair hearing permanently and about 1 percent of the population
            suffers from noise-induced pollution. Singh, N. (no date) CITESEERX,

          <h4>Biligsaikhan - Understanding APIs</h4>
          <p>
            This literature review will discuss general information surrounding
            APIs benefits and their drawbacks. API, or application programming
            interface, is one of the primary tools people use for software
            development. It serves as a bridge to allow its users to utilize
            pre-made functionalities and helps them time and effort in the
            development process (Lamothe, M., Guéhéneuc, Y. G., & Shang, W.,
            2021). Since 2008 after the launch of well-known open-source
            repositories GitHub and StackOverflow, API has experienced an
            enormous gain in its user base.(Lamothe, M., Guéhéneuc, Y. G., &
            Shang, W., 2021). Nowadays, APIs have become an integral part of
            programming practices, with nearly every line of code written by
            programmers utilizing API calls. Numerous organizations support them
            by making their internal data accessible through public APIs, and
            according to recent data on http://www.programmableweb.com, over
            24000 public APIs are available on the web (Myers, B. A., & Stylos,
            J., 2016). Although APIs are widespread thanks to their many
            benefits, sometimes even the experts among programmers struggle to
            understand them. This issue occurs due to the importance of API
            documentation. API documentation includes guidelines and references
            to help developers to understand and implement its features. Without
            proper documentation, no matter how well developers design their
            APIs, people will not use them as they will not be able to fully
            take in their capabilities (Robillard, M. P., & DeLine, R., 2011).
            As a way to solve the issue and lessen the variance in
            documentation, developers follow API documentation formats such as
            OpenAPI Specification, API Blueprint, and RAML. (254 words)

          <h4>Muting - How air pollution affects people</h4>
          <p>
            All components of air pollution are harmful to human health, but the
            most serious impact is from atmospheric PM which contains various
            toxic substances and carries them into the respiratory tract. When
            breathing in PM, coarse particles will remain in the nasal cavity
            and upper respiratory tract of people, and fine and ultrafine
            particles of PM may though the alveoli and enter the bloodstream[1].
            Research has shown that the increase in mortality rate is related to
            short-term and long-term exposure to PM. The percentage increase of
            all-cause mortality associated with short-term PM exposure is
            between 0.4% and 1.5% for each 20 micrograms/m3 increase in coarse
            PM10, and between 0.6% and 1.2% for every 10 micrograms/cubic meter
            increase in finer PM2.5. [2] These increases are much higher in
            Southeast Asian countries, especially in China and India, people
            there is facing high-levels air pollution due to the rapid
            development of industry and dense population. [3] In addition, air
            pollution is also related to the increase in mortality and
            hospitalization caused by cardiovascular and respiratory disease.
            Air pollution and Vascular disease Various studies have found that
            there are relationships between air pollution and cardiovascular
            diseases, the most important one is after breathing in the PM, the
            activation of inflammatory pathways, primary and secondary
            hemostasis and production of reactive oxygen species. [4] In
            addition, PM increase by 10 μG/m3 is associated with a 4.5%
            increased risk of acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina and
            myocardial infarction) [5]. About heart failure, in a British study,
            long-term exposure to PM and NO2 was associated with an increased
            incidence rate. Moreover, a recent analysis showed a positive
            correlation between short-term increases in gas composition and PM
            and the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. [6] With regard
            to Cerebrovascular disease, studies have shown that there are
            relationships between air pollution and stroke incidence rate and
            mortality. In the United States and Denmark, for every 10
            micrograms/cubic meter increase in long-term PM2.5 exposure, non
            fatal and fatal strokes increased by 35% and 83%[7]. Similarly, in
            China, exposure to PM10 and NO2 is also associated with an increase
            in cerebrovascular mortality. [8] Air pollution and Respiratory
            disease Exposure to air pollutants is associated with Chronic
            obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory infection,
            cancer and respiratory allergy[9]. In a study on the number of
            admissions related to heart and lung diseases in the United States,
            for every 10 micrograms/cubic meter increase in PM10, the number of
            COPD admissions increased by 2.5%[10]. Another study found that a
            sudden increase in PM2.5 is associated with an increased risk of
            hospitalization for COPD by approximately 0.9%[11]. On the other
            hand, a study conducted in the heavily polluted city of Los Angeles
            reported that since 1994, with the gradual improvement of air
            quality in the city area, the lung function of adolescents has
            improved[12]. Association with other diseases The data indicates a
            connection between air pollutants and the deterioration of allergic
            diseases (rhinitis, eczema, etc.) [13]. Diabetes and cognitive
            effects are also associated with exposure to air pollutants. And
            recently, people are concerned that air pollutants may have an
            impact on pregnancy and the first extrauterine life cycle [14]. Some
            studies have also found an association between exposure to air
            pollution during pregnancy and low birth weight at term and delayed
            psychomotor development in childhood [15]. Reference [1] Brown JS,

          <h4>Zhenyu - Measurement of Air Quality Index</h4>
          <p>
            Monitoring air quality is important, so as to understand and address
            the problems of air pollution. While traditional methods like lab
            sampling and analysis have been phased out due to it being
            time-consuming and expensive, newer methods including the use of
            sensors have been implemented into measuring the different factors
            that make up the Air Quality Index, or AQI for short. These
            sensor-based technologies offer continuous and accurate measurements
            of various pollutants. The information that is generated from these
            sensor-based systems are crucial; quick and real time information is
            needed to provide the latest updates. According to a research paper
            done by Shiram and Malladi (2021), AQI is measured by as many as
            seven different parameters, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur
            dioxide (SO2), ground level Ozone (O3), particulate matter 2.5
            (PM2.5), particulate matter 10 (PM10), carbon oxide (CO) and Ammonia
            (NH3) levels. These pollutants are measured in the air via sensor
            technologies and an average score is produced, to produce the AQI.
            In a paper done by Concas et al. (2021), however, stated that as
            more low-cost air quality sensing is more widely used, the quality
            of the results can suffer, due to cross-sensitivities between
            different ambient pollutants, as well as external factors like
            traffic, weather changes and human behaviour. While the information
            generated might face inaccuracies because of the quality of sensor
            that is used, the information would nevertheless prove useful to our
            application. The data and AQI score that is generated is crucial to
            the application because it would form the backbone and basis of the
            air quality application.   References: Shriram, P., &amp; Malladi,
